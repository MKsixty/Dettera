- üì∏ Image Management: Stores and manages detection images with timestamps
- üö® Deterrence System: Configurable deterrence methods including:
  - LED controls (frequency and duty cycle)
  - Speaker controls (frequency and duty cycle)
  - Motor controls (ON/OFF)
- üìä Detection Records: Maintains detailed logs of all detections and deterrence actions
- üåê REST API: Full API support for retrieving detections and adding new records
